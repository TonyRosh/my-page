            <p>I hope you enjoy that little video of my pup! Her name is Blanca and, when I am not studying coding, she is my world!</p>
            <p>My journey into software engineering started in January of 2021. I was in the restaurant industry for 15 years until the pandemic cause my restaurant to close. I wasn't sure I wanted to pursue another food service job, and I had some family who had recently completed a coding boot camp, much like <a href="https://flatironschool.com/welcome-to-flatiron-school/?utm_source=Google&utm_medium=ppc&utm_campaign=1783325438&utm_content=75897432663&utm_term=flatiron%20scholarship&uqaid=488305145646&EAIaIQobChMI6L-kvb_-7wIVQ_HACh1wrgyUEAAYASAAEgIgz_D_BwE&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6L-kvb_-7wIVQ_HACh1wrgyUEAAYASAAEgIgz_D_BwE">Flatiron School</a>. They convinced me that it was a path I needed to follow, so I downloaded a few coding apps to see what it was like. The more I dove into those apps, the more I enjoyed the process and I eventually decided this was something I wanted to pursue! I did some research and found Flatiron School and decided to apply. My courses start on April 26th, and I am very excited to step into the world of coding!</p>
            <p>When I'm not coding or playing with my dog, you can usually catch me producing music or enjoying a spooky horror film. If you are into EDM (more specifically, dubstep) then feel free to give my music a listen at <a href="https://soundcloud.com/musicpizzasnax">Snax on Soundcloud</a>! If you have horror movie suggestions, I am all ears!</p>
            <p>Denver, Colorado has been home to me my whole life, but I recently also bought property the beautiful city of Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, Mexico! That has been my favorite place in the world to vacation to for years, and I am thrilled to call it my part time home now! I will be renting my condo when I'm not there, so if you're interested in taking a vacation to Mexico, feel free to reach out for details!!</p>
